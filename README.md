# PX4-ROS2 UAV-UGV Collaborative Surveillance System

This project enables **coordinated surveillance and reconnaissance** with a semi autonomous UAV (PX4-based drone) that follows and collaborates with a semi-autonomous UGV for field operations.

## Features

- **Keyboard Teleoperation**: Control the UAV in simulation using simple keyboard commands (adapted from https://github.com/monemati/PX4-ROS2-Gazebo-YOLOv8/)
- **PX4 SITL Integration**: Seamless interfacing with PX4 Autopilot for reliable flight control and SITL simulation.
- **ROS2 Modular Design**: Nodes for drone control, camera streaming, object detection, and inter-robot data exchange.
- **UGV Integration**: Ready to work with ROS2-based UGV ([armybot_diff_drive](https://github.com/ShauryaJain03/armybot_diff_drive)).
- **Camera Feed Processing**: Access and process UAV camera stream directly in ROS2 (for detection, tracking, etc.).
- UGV Spawned with the UAV in a custom world to test following modules and enable data sharing
